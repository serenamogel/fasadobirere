His professional career has been active since 2006.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich DeAngelo Williams is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that DeAngelo`s net worth is as high as $27 million, an amount he has acquired through his successful career as a football player; his salary amounts to $2 million per year.</p><h3>DeAngelo Williams Net Worth $27 Million</h3><p>DeAngelo was raised by his mother, in his hometown; he went to Wynne High School, where he played football for the school`s team. Little by little he progressed, and in his junior season, DeAngelo had 1,044 rushing yards, with 14 touchdowns, which earned him All-American honors. He led his team to the state 4A championship in his senior season, in which he had an outstanding 2,204 rushing yards, and 34 touchdowns. That year, DeAngelo was named the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette 2001 Offensive Player of the Year, and was selected in the Associated Press Arkansas Super Team in 2001.</p><p>After high school, DeAngelo enrolled at the University of Memphis, and played for the Memphis Tigers, and during his college career amassed 6,026 rushing yards and 55 touchdowns, and also had 723 receiving yards and five touchdowns. He set several records, including the NCAA record for most 100-yard rushing games with 34. Also he was selected in the First-team All-American and received the ARA Sportsmanship Award.</p><p>After his graduation, DeAngelo entered the 2006 NFL Draft, in which he was selected by the Carolina Panthers. This marked the start of his professional career, and the start of his net worth. DeAngelo played for the Panthers until the end of the 2014 season, becoming one of the best franchise players, as he set numerous records. Although he had only 501 rushing yards in his first season, and only one touchdown, his numbers then increased, and in his third season he recorded 1,515 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns, his best season to date, and in 2009 he had 1,117 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. In the following season he played in only 6 games, as he injured his foot, and was limited to 361 rushing yards and one touchdown. In 2010, DeAngelo signed a contract extension worth $43 million over five years, which increased his net worth by a large margin. However, he was released from the club before his contract expired, due to his poor performances, and also as Jonathan Stewart performed much better than DeAngelo.</p><p>Soon enough, DeAngelo signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worth $4 million over two years, which added to his net worth. In his first and only season so far in Pittsburgh, DeAngelo`s form was back on track, as he had 907 rushing yards, and 11 touchdowns, which is the most since his best season.</p><p>During his career, DeAngelo has set numerous records, and has won several awards and honors; he holds the Carolina Panthers` records for most career rushing yards with 6,699, longest rushing attempt with 77 yards, and for most rushing touchdowns in a single season at 18, among other records. He has earned one Pro-Bowl selection, in 2009, and in 2008 he was named the PFWA Most Improved Player of the Year. Furthermore, he has has been the NFL Rushing Touchdowns Leader twice, in 2009 and 2016.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, DeAngelo has been in a relationship with Risalyn Burzynski, with whom he has three children.<br>He is also recognized as a philanthropist; he worked with Susan G. Komen in her campaigns and organizations, fighting breast cancer; DeAngelo`s mother died from breast cancer in 2014.</p>ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿<h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Exception</td><td>2013</td><td>Short executive producer / producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Writer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=writer><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Exception</td><td>2013</td><td>Short co-writer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Camera Department <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=camera_department><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Tonsure</td><td>2014</td><td>Short media manager</td><td></td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp2cmqaXmrmwedaio6WhkaLAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdeangelo-williams-net-worth.html&text=DeAngelo%20Williams%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdeangelo-williams-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdeangelo-williams-net-worth.html&title=DeAngelo%20Williams%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdeangelo-williams-net-worth.html&title=DeAngelo%20Williams%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdeangelo-williams-net-worth.html&title=DeAngelo%20Williams%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdeangelo-williams-net-worth.html&description=DeAngelo%20Williams%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./usc-nick-donofrio-obituary-and-death-cause.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="USC Nick Donofrio Obituary &amp;amp; Death Cause Linked To Shooting">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./billie-movie-review-2020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2020)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
