Since then, his case is still under investigation and is unsolved.

Many investigations were done, and his parents reported a Brandon missing case to the Lynd Police.</p><p>Moreover, the investigators also searched in that area; associates found Brandon’s abandoned car in a ditch off a gravel road along the Lincoln County line a mile north of Highway 68.</p><p>Similalry, they brought the office of that county’s sheriff, Jack Vizecky, into the investigation; he informed the media that the Lumina had gotten hung up on the top of an incline at the edge of the road, not seriously enough to damage the car.</p><p>Except for that, there was nothing else found amiss with the car. Likewise, as the area was covered with grass and gravel, there were no tracks and, therefore, no way to tell what direction Brandon might have gone.</p><p>Seriously, the case still amazed many of us as Brandon is unknown whether he is dead or still alive. But we can feel the pain and sorrow of his parents and their hopes to get their son back.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=insight-on-brandon-swanson-age-and-parents></span>Insight On Brandon Swanson Age And Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brandon Swanson is well known for his missing case, which is still unsolved. Similalry, Brandon&nbsp;was&nbsp;19 years old at the age of his disappearance. Talking about his birth details.&nbsp;Brandon was born on January 30, 1998.</p><p>Further, the case has almost been 13 years old. Furthermore, his parents’ names are Brian Swanson and Annette Swanson.</p><p>Further, there is not much available about his parent’s details. As we speak, Swanson was a student of Marshall Senior High School. Similalry, he was the native of Marshall, the seat of Lyon County in southwestern Minnesota.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brandon-swanson-phone-calls-details></span>Brandon Swanson Phone Calls Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brandon Swanson had his last call with his parents. According to the sources, Brandon called his parents to pick him up, where he mentioned he had driven his Chevrolet Lumina off the road and into a ditch from which he could not remove the car.</p><p>Similalry, in the phone call, Brandon was not hurt and asked them to come to where he was. But shortly after 2:30 a.m., after 47 minutes into the call, Brandon suddenly stopped himself on the phone and said, “Oh, shit!”</p><p>So, this was Brandon’s last and final call with his bloodlines, after which he has not been in contact with anyone since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqilrulu81mqrCZnqi8r3nUqZuarJVif3F%2BkGaumqtdnbJusdWeqWaen6q7pXnLmqqtZaCdvK%2BxjJyYpaRdmbK1rcilqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrandon-swanson-update-2021-was-he-ever-found-last-phone-call-details.html&text=Brandon%20Swanson%20Update%3a%20Was%20He%20Ever%20Found%3f%20Last%20Phone%20Call%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrandon-swanson-update-2021-was-he-ever-found-last-phone-call-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrandon-swanson-update-2021-was-he-ever-found-last-phone-call-details.html&title=Brandon%20Swanson%20Update%3a%20Was%20He%20Ever%20Found%3f%20Last%20Phone%20Call%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrandon-swanson-update-2021-was-he-ever-found-last-phone-call-details.html&title=Brandon%20Swanson%20Update%3a%20Was%20He%20Ever%20Found%3f%20Last%20Phone%20Call%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrandon-swanson-update-2021-was-he-ever-found-last-phone-call-details.html&title=Brandon%20Swanson%20Update%3a%20Was%20He%20Ever%20Found%3f%20Last%20Phone%20Call%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrandon-swanson-update-2021-was-he-ever-found-last-phone-call-details.html&description=Brandon%20Swanson%20Update%3a%20Was%20He%20Ever%20Found%3f%20Last%20Phone%20Call%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./courtney-paris-age-wiki-biography-body-measurement-parents-family-salary-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courtney Paris Age, Wiki, Biography, Body Measurement, Parents, Family, Salary, Net worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./method-man-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Method Man Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
