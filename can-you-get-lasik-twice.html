The short answer is <b>yes, though this is usually only done 5 – 10 years after the initial treatment</b>. However, rest assured that LASIK offers long-term vision correction, and very few people require a second session.</span></span><h2>How many times can LASIK be repeated?</h2>Some patients also worry about the number of times enhancement can be performed. There is no magic number but really no one needs a repeat lasik procedure more than one or two times. However every time prior to the procedure, pre lasik testing should be done to ensure suitability.<h2>Can LASIK be repeated years later?</h2>According to a study that examined LASIK's permanence, 35% of LASIK patients needed LASIK enhancement after 10 years. Most of the time, needing to repeat LASIK surgery after 10 years might be necessary because of an underlying condition that changes the vision over time, such as cataracts or presbyopia.<h2>Can you have LASIK 3 times?</h2>Lasik can be performed more than once, but more than three treatments may be harmful to your health and could be fruitless in the end by causing even more severe vision problems.<h2>Can LASIK surgery wear off?</h2>No, the effects of LASIK do not wear off. However, certain normal aging changes inside the eye over time may affect refractive stability. For example, if your eyes had been corrected for distance when you're younger, when you get into your early or mid-forties, something called presbyopia will occur.<h2>Does LASIK wear-off? The PanOptix lens for patients with prior LASIK and Laser Lens Replacement.</h2><p></p><h2>What causes blurry vision after LASIK?</h2>Dry Eyes: Creating the LASIK flap will temporarily disrupt nerves that supply the cornea. These nerves usually regenerate in the first 3-6 months after LASIK. During this time, the eyes tend to be dry and this can cause vision to be blurred or to fluctuate.<h2>What age is good for LASIK?</h2>LASIK: 25-40<p>Generally speaking, most LASIK eye surgeons agree on 25-40 as the ideal age range for LASIK eye surgery candidacy for a few reasons. By the age of 25, eyeglasses and contact lens prescriptions have most likely stabilized. A stable prescription is one of the hallmarks of a good LASIK candidate.</p><h2>Does LASIK fix astigmatism?</h2>The ultra-precise lasers used for LASIK surgery can be programmed to reshape the cornea so the front surface of the eye is more symmetrical, thereby eliminating vision problems caused by astigmatism. Most of the time astigmatism can be fully corrected with a single LASIK procedure.<h2>Is PRK or LASIK better?</h2>Overall, PRK is considered to be safer and more effective in the long term because it doesn't leave a flap in your cornea. The flap left behind by LASIK can be subject to greater damage or complications if your eye is injured.<h2>Is 55 too old for LASIK eye surgery?</h2>While the minimum age for LASIK surgery is 18, there is no age limit as long as your eyes are healthy and your vision is stable.<h2>What is a LASIK touch up?</h2>LASIK enhancement, sometimes called a LASIK touch up, is a follow up procedure done with the goal of further sharpening your vision if you're not happy with the initial LASIK results or if your vision has changed over time. LASIK can be a permanent solution for living without glasses or contacts.<h2>Does LASIK flap ever fully heal?</h2>While LASIK recovery time will vary from person to person, it may take up to three months for the LASIK flap to completely finish the healing process. That being said, the flap should be mostly healed and secure after one week and most normal activities can be resumed at that time.<h2>Is PRK more expensive than LASIK?</h2>The difference in price between LASIK and PRK can be as much as $1200. LASIK surgery ranges in price between $1000 to $2600 per eye to perform. PRK laser eye surgery's average cost is $2000 to $4000 for both eyes. Both procedures are considered an elective procedure and therefore are typically paid out of pocket.<h2>Is there anything better than LASIK?</h2>The four alternatives to traditional LASIK eye surgery are LASEK, Phakic Intraocular Lens Implants, Epi-LASIK, and Refractive Lens Exchange Surgery. If you have thin or flat corneas, LASEK is one of the best LASIK alternatives. The procedure doesn't involve the use of a laser or blade.<h2>What prescription is too high for LASIK?</h2>The prescription limit for treating hyperopia with LASIK is typically somewhere around 3.0 to 4.0 D. Most clinics don't treat severely hyperopic patients, +5 or over, as they do not have the technology or expertise to do so safely.<h2>Is LASIK worth it over 40?</h2>Of course, LASIK eligibility depends on quite a few factors, several of which are unique from person to person. But the answer is generally yes – LASIK is worth it after 40. LASIK is safe and effective for patients older than 40 and produces the long-term value that this refractive surgery is known for.<h2>Does LASIK fix floaters?</h2>Can LASIK Surgery Fix Floaters? Because we know that floaters live inside of your eye and not on the surface, the answer is no. LASIK surgery only has the ability to change the shape of your cornea and cannot fix anything going on inside of your eye cavity.<h2>Can you go blind from LASIK?</h2>MYTH #2: You will go blind. Actually, as of this writing, there are no reported cases of blindness due to LASIK surgery itself. In a recent study, it was discovered that patients actually have a 34 times higher risk of going blind from a contact lens infection than going blind from LASIK.<h2>Is LASIK painful?</h2>Fortunately, LASIK eye surgery is not painful. Right before your procedure, your surgeon will place numbing eye drops into both of your eyes. While you may still feel a little bit of pressure during the procedure, you should not feel any pain.<h2>What is PRK surgery?</h2>Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a laser eye surgery — specifically a type of refractive surgery. A refractive problem is where your eyes don't bend light properly, which keeps you from seeing your best.<h2>What is ghosting after LASIK?</h2>Most of the time it has to do with the edema (swelling) created in the eye due to the surgery. As the eye heals, the ghosting disappears. If the ghosting happens with both eyes, then the eyes may be out of alignment and need additional adjustment. Ophthalmologists prescribe eyedrops for the condition.<h2>Will I ever need glasses after LASIK?</h2>Patients typically undergo laser eye surgery to reduce or completely eliminate their need for visual aids such as contact lenses and glasses. The truth is that most patients will eventually require reading glasses at some point in their future.<h2>How long does it take to get 20/20 vision after LASIK?</h2>During a LASIK procedure, a laser is used to change the shape of one or both corneas to improve vision. According to the American Refractive Surgery Council, more than 90% of LASIK patients achieve 20/20 vision or better after 2 to 3 months of post-surgery recovery.<h2>Does PRK fix astigmatism?</h2>Your eye doctor can tell you which treatment options are right for you. Two laser surgeries that can treat astigmatism are LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) and PRK (photorefractive keratectomy).<h2>Why is PRK so painful?</h2>According to Adler, the surgery itself is painless because of the numbing eye drops, but once the effect of the drops wears off, you may start to feel some discomfort. This sometimes feels like a scratch on the eye and lasts for about four days after the surgery.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6qLHTZqOaq5mgerXDyJyc</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcan-you-get-lasik-twice.html&text=Can%20you%20get%20LASIK%20twice%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-you-get-lasik-twice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-get-lasik-twice.html&title=Can%20you%20get%20LASIK%20twice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcan-you-get-lasik-twice.html&title=Can%20you%20get%20LASIK%20twice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-get-lasik-twice.html&title=Can%20you%20get%20LASIK%20twice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-you-get-lasik-twice.html&description=Can%20you%20get%20LASIK%20twice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lynyrd-skynyrd-members.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lynyrd Skynyrd Members: Who Are Lynyrd Skynyrds Members">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./raphy-pina-biografia-and-wikipedia-altura-and-ex-esposa-why-was-he-arrested.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Raphy Pina Biografa and Wikipedia  Altura and Ex Esposa, Why Was He Arrested?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
