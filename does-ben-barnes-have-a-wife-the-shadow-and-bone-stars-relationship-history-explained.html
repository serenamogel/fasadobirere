A couple of sources covered the subject of Hough and Barnes’ romance. As per the account of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Life & Style</a>:</p><p>“They’ve officially been an item for two months and he has been flying to and from L.A. to be with her in New York.

She’s never been happier.”</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=false>In the very same year on Aug. 18, Barnes was seen leaving Julianne’s apartment, sparking the fans’ curiosities. Despite the seemingly intriguing love story, neither Barnes nor Hough commented on the rumors.
