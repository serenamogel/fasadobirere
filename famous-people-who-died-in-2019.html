As the bass guitarist for his TV band, Tork produced a number of albums with The Monkees, but because of his teen idol status, never managed to be taken seriously by music critics. He quit The Monkees in 1968 and had a falling out with fellow members Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/davy-jones data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Davy Jones" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Davy Jones</a> in the early 2000s before reconciling with them and participating in a number of reunion tours and albums.
