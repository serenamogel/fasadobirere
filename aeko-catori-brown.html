His aunt, <a href=#><strong>Lytrell Bundy</strong></a> was quite happy with his arrival. Despite rumors of Ammika being pregnant with Brown's child, the couple kept the birth of their child for a month.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/6/Aeko%20Catori%20Brown%20with%20his%20mother%20Ammika%20Harris-1691312720900.jpg><p>It was in December 2019 when the American singer shared the picture of his second child. In the post, Chris revealed his newborn child's full name.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of names, Ammika's first-born child's name is of Japanese and Native American origin. Aeko means "rare" and Catori means "spirit". Chris Brown said that his son's name is pronounced "echo".</p><h2>Aeko Catori Brown's Parents Love Life</h2><p>Aeko Catori Brown's parents, Chris Brown and Ammika Harris are not married yet.
