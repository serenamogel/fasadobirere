real name.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>I have noticed this several times when we conducted a poll asking 100 fans of Nigerian singer </span><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>Davido</span></a><span> to answer the question of what is the real name of Davido.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Now it was interesting to find what that study revealed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><p><span>85% of the people that took the poll got their answers wrong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We rinsed and repeat the process for other musicians and it was crazy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>My point is 90% of fans will get the name of their favorite musician partially wrong or totally wrong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>With that said </span><b>what is the real name of Plies</b><span>?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>The real name of Plies is Algernod

2007 to 2011, Plies has been nominated for several awards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Although he failed to take home the Grammy which has been his highest nomination to
