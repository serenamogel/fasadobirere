He is the first Canadian to receive the honor. The Oscar win completed a triumphant return to prominence for Fraser after his number of leading roles slowed in the mid-to-late 2000s. The hiatus was partially on account of a number of health problems, but the actor has also cited personal matters, including a sexual assault he says he experienced in 2003.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Brendan James Fraser<br>BORN: December 3, 1968<br>BIRTHPLACE: Indianapolis, Indiana<br>SPOUSE: Afton Smith (1998-2009)<br>CHILDREN: Griffin, Holden, and Leland<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Early Life and Education" data-anchor-id=early-life-and-education class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Brendan James Fraser was born on December 3, 1968, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Canadian parents Peter and Carol Mary Fraser. Brendan is the youngest of four siblings, including brothers Kevin, Regan, and Sean. He holds dual citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to his own stardom, Brendan’s claim to fame was his maternal uncle George Genereux, who won a gold medal in trap shooting at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, and was later inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Peter is a former journalist who moved to the United States to work as a foreign service officer for Canada’s Government Office of Tourism. Because of his position, the family relocated every few years and spent time in multiple countries. These international travels influenced young Brendan in multiple ways. He learned to speak French while living in Ottawa, Ontario, and picked up Dutch in The Hague, Netherlands. Attending theater shows in London as a child from ages 6 through 8 first sparked his interest in acting. He would later study it in school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser’s early education included stops at a Montessori school in Detroit and the Sacred Heart School in Bellevue, Washington. Brendan graduated from Upper Canada College, an all-boys preparatory boarding school in Toronto, Ontario, in 1987 and then studied at the Actors’ Conservatory at the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle, Washington.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 1991, Fraser borrowed his mother’s car and drove from Seattle to Hollywood with hopes of making it big as an actor.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="Encino Man and Early Movies" data-anchor-id=encino-man-and-early-movies class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Encino Man and Early Movies</h2><img alt="sean astin, brendan fraser, and pauly shore in character for encino man, astin and shore groom fraser who wears a bath towel and towel on his head" title="Sean Astin, Brendan Fraser, and Pauly Shore in ‘Encino Man’" width=4303 height=2865 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brendan-fraser-is-being-groomed-by-sean-astin-and-pauly-news-photo-1693268925.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Sean Astin, Brendan Fraser, and Pauly Shore starred in Encino Man (1992).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser quickly earned his first Hollywood role with a small part as a sailor in the 1991 film Dogfight, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/river-phoenix data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="River Phoenix" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">River Phoenix</a> and Lili Taylor. His breakthrough came a year later with a starring role in the 1992 comedy film Encino Man. Fraser played a frozen caveman named Link, who is thawed out by two high school friends and must adjust to life in modern day Los Angeles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser said he drew inspiration from some of his acting heroes like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/buster-keaton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Buster Keaton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Buster Keaton</a> and Bill Irwin for his deadpan performance. “I was pretty wide-eyed about being in this big Hollywood comedy at the time that was produced by Disney,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/brendan-fraser-talks-encino-man-cave-man-acting-approach data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fraser told Syfy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Fraser told Syfy</a> in 2022. “I guess I really just had to show up to work and feel like, ‘Wow—what is going on around me?!’ And that’s what Link was doing all the time.” The film was moderately successful, grossing more than $40 million, but has since become a cult classic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in 1992, Fraser had the starring role in the coming-of-age drama School Ties alongside rising actors <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/matt-damon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matt Damon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Matt Damon</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-affleck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Affleck" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Affleck</a>, and Chris O’Donnell. Over the next four years, he appeared in films such as Twenty Bucks (1993), With Honors (1994), Airheads (1994), The Passion of Darkly Noon (1995), and The Twilight of the Golds (1996) before his career really began to take off.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 title="Stardom with George of the Jungle and The Mummy" data-anchor-id=stardom-with-george-of-the-jungle-and-the-mummy class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Stardom with George of the Jungle and The Mummy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser’s first major box office hit was the 1997 Disney movie George of the Jungle, in which he played a man raised in the jungle by animals in a clear spoof of the Tarzan story.

Also in 1999, he played his most recognizable role to date, as adventurer Rick O’Connell in the first film of The Mummy action trilogy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser felt obligated to do his own stunts because of his large salary for The Mummy and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/brendan-fraser-nearly-died-the-mummy-hanging-sequence-1235338499/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revealed in 2023" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">revealed in 2023</a> he nearly died on set while performing a hanging scene. “ [The stunt coordinator] was pulling up, and I was going down, and the next thing I knew, my elbow was in my ear, the world was sideways, there was gravel in my teeth, and everyone was really quiet,” he recalled on The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kelly-clarkson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kelly Clarkson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kelly Clarkson</a> Show. But Fraser’s dedication paid off, as the movie spawned two sequels—The Mummy Returns in 2001 and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor in 2008—and the trilogy collectively grossed more than $1.4 billion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser also showed off his acting prowess in other genres around this time.

In that same 2018 interview with GQ, the actor says the former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, Philip Berk, groped his buttocks and genitals and that he had to forcibly remove his hand. “I felt like there was a ball in my throat.
