Standing at 6’5″, he is the tallest of the Cullens, towering over Alice by nearly two feet.</p><p>Like all Cullens, Emmett is a vegetarian vampire, and has gold eyes instead of red like vampires who drink human blood. Even considering the unstoppable physical strength of vampires, Emmett is physically the strongest in the family. His faceclaim is Kellan Lutz.</p><h2>Who is Emmett Cullens?</h2><p>Emmett Cullens (born Emmett McCarty in 1915 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee) is a member of the Olympic coven. He is the husband of Rosaile Hale, the adoptive son of Carlisle Cullens, the adoptive brother of Alice, Edward Cullens, Jasper Hale, and Jacob Black as well as the adoptive uncle of Renesmee Cullens. He is the father of Carter, Rosabella, Jace, Taylor, Aurora, Gisele, Athena, Alena, Grayson, Seraphina, Victoria, and Emmalee.</p><p>Emmett is the husband of Rosaile Hale, the adoptive son of Dr. Carlisle Cullens, the adoptive brother of Alice, Edward Cullens, Jasper Hale, and Jacob Black as well as the adoptive uncle of Aria, Aiden, Sage, and Renesmee Cullens. He is the father of Carter, Rosabella, Jace, Taylor, Athena, Alena, Grayson, Seraphina, Victoria, and Emmalee and the adoptive father of Gisele and Aurora.</p><p>Emmett is a naturally cheerful and childish character. He loves to laugh and make jokes, and would try to lighten up tense situations with his sense of humor. Unlike some of his family members, he never hesitates to speak his mind, which makes Edward very comfortable to be around him. He appears to be thoughtless, impatient, reckless, makes rash decisions and allow his instincts to take over, but also optimistic and never worries about things beyond his control.</p><p>Emmett McCarty was born in 1915 and grew up in the small town of<strong> Gatlinburg,</strong> Tennessee, as part of a large Scotch-Irish family. He had what his parents considered a wild adolescence, never one to worry about consequences and preferring to gamble, drink, and womanize. However, he was a loving child of his family who always kept them supplied with game. He worked on the railroad with his older brothers, George and James, in Gatlinburg, while his younger 14 year old sister, Anna, would help their mother with housework.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Emmett has no supernatural talents, but his physical strength as a human was magnified when he became a vampire, which makes him much stronger than the regular vampire. In combat, he relies on strength and would fight so fiercely that others view him as a very intimidating opponent. He is known as the physically strongest vampire in the Cullens family, but not the best fighter.</p><h2>How tall is Kellan Lutz?</h2><p>4 Tallest: Kellan Lutz (6’1″) Kellan Lutz is surprisingly the same height as his on-screen vampire brother Robert Pattinson as the two measure up to a tall 6’1″.</p><p>6 Tallest:<strong> Billy Burke</strong> (6’0″) One of the best on-screen fathers in the Twilight film series is most definitely Charlie Swan for his caring, protective, and sometimes overbearing parenting style.<strong> Billy Burke</strong> is coming in at a roaring 6’0″, which is very close to his co-stars Robert Pattinson and Kellan Lutz. After filming for the movie series came …</p><p>The not-so-sparkling vampire in real-life, Robert Pattinson is not surprisingly one of the tallest actors in the Twilight cast coming in at<strong> 6’1″.</strong> His portrayal of Edward Cullen throughout the film series was nothing short of iconic and definitely made him a huge star since the release of the first film.</p><p>Although he plays the super intimidating and massive werewolf Jacob Black in the Twilight movie saga, in real life Taylor Lautner is actually pretty short compared to his fellow costars, coming in at<strong> 5’9″.</strong></p><p>Barely making it on the tall scale, Jackson Rathbone comes in at<strong> 5’10”</strong> and is only an inch taller than co-star Taylor Lautner. Rathbone portrays the shy but easily lovable Jasper Cullen who at first seems a little standoffish in the first film, but quickly became a fan favorite with his sense of humor and sweet personality.</p><p>7 Shortest: Kristen Stewart<strong> (5’5″)</strong> Kristen Stewart, also known as the iconic Bella Swan, is known for being clumsy and petite, one of which is very true in real life since the actress is only 5’5″.</p><p>1 Shortest:<strong> Elizabeth Reaser</strong> (5’3″) Coming in as the shortest actress in the Twilight saga is<strong> Elizabeth Reaser</strong> at 5’3″ who plays the lovable adoptive vampire mother Esme Cullen.</p><h2>Who is Emmett Cullen?</h2><p>Just turn it off for one minute and fight fair.”. Emmett Cullen (born Emmett McCarty in 1915 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee) is<strong> a member of the Olympic coven.</strong> He is the husband of Rosalie Hale, the adoptive son of Carlisle and Esme Cullen, the adoptive brother of Alice, Edward Cullen and Jasper Hale as well as adoptive brother-in-law …</p><p>Jessica Stanley refers to him as “the big dark-haired guy” in the first Twilight movie . Standing at<strong> 6’5″,</strong> he is the tallest of the Cullens, towering over Alice by nearly two feet.</p><p>When Edward takes Bella to meet his family, Emmett is absent<strong> because Rosalie is upset by the idea and he tries to comfort her.</strong> While playing baseball together, Bella (with Edward and his family’s protective reaction) catches dangerous interest from the tracker James, who wishes to kill her for sport.</p><p>When Rosalie came across him, Emmett was being mauled by a black bear in the mountains of Tennessee. He had nearly died from the attack, but Rosalie saved him and carried him over a hundred miles back to Carlisle. Rosalie was noted as saying that it took nearly all her strength not to kill him.</p><p>Many years later, Rosalie confessed to Bella that she saved Emmett from dying<strong> because of his innocent look, dimples, and curly hair that reminded her of her best friend Vera ‘s child, Henry, and that ever since the day she saw the baby she always wanted a child of her own just like him.</strong></p><p>Emmett in Twilight. Two years prior to the beginning of Twilight, he moved to Forks with his family from Alaska, where he started attending Forks High School with Rosalie, Jasper, Alice and Edward . He first meets new girl, Bella Swan, on her first day at school during the spring semester.</p><p>Personality and traits. Emmett playing baseball. Emmett is<strong> a naturally cheerful and childish character </strong>. He loves to laugh and make jokes, and would try to lighten up tense situations with his sense of humor.
