A colleague suggested The Juilliard School; Yale University; New York University; and Purchase College, part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She wanted to apply for all four but only had enough money for one application fee, so she chose Juilliard, according to her memoir, Finding Me.

She portrayed Tanya, the title character’s wife, who considers getting an abortion in one of the play’s most memorable monologues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Davis received rave reviews; <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://old.post-gazette.com/magazine/20010502hedley6.asp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="theater critic Christopher Rawson wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">theater critic Christopher Rawson wrote</a> that she “has a dead-on intensity which, when she launches into her great aria about parenthood and death, sweeps all before it.” Davis was again nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress (Featured Role – Play), and this time she won it.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film Breakthrough in Doubt</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Several years later, Davis received her most widespread attention to date with her role in the 2008 film Doubt, adapted from Scott Rudin’s Tony-winning play. “I knew this was it,” Davis wrote in Finding Me. “This was the game-changing role.” She played the mother of the only Black student in a Catholic parish school, who may have been abused by one of the priests.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Davis appears in only one 10-minute scene, but as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/doubt-2008 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="film critic Roger Ebert wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">film critic Roger Ebert wrote</a>, “it is the emotional heart and soul of Doubt, and if Viola Davis isn’t nominated by the Academy, an injustice will have been done.” She, indeed, did receive her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Production Company Formed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, Davis and her husband, Julius Tennon, co-founded JuVee Productions, a production company that develops and produces independent films, television, theater, and digital projects. Their goal is to create a platform that provides opportunities for artists from underrepresented communities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I always say if you want to see where your career is going, see where the top people are in your category, and I didn’t see anything,” Davis <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thewrap.com/viola-davis-juvee-productions-prestige-roles-black-actors/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said at a conference in 2022" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said at a conference in 2022</a>. “The talent is there, but the material was not.
