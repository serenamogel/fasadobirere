Follow-up albums like Everywhere We Go, No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems and When the Sun Goes Down cemented his place as a top-selling act, with the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association both honoring him as Entertainer of the Year multiple times.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Country singer Kenny Chesney was born on March 26, 1968, in Knoxville, Tennessee. While attending East Tennessee State, Chesney hooked up with a college band and started writing his own songs and playing at local bars. The hard-working musician eventually recorded an album to sell at his shows. After graduating with a degree in marketing in 1991, he headed to Nashville to pursue a career in music.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Albums and Hit Songs</h2><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'All I Need to Know,' 'Me and You,' 'I Will Stand,' 'Everywhere We Go'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After modest sales on recordings he completed with Opryland Music Group and Capricorn Records, Chesney caught the attention of RCA's affiliate, BNA Records. It was while with BNA that the singer went gold with All I Need to Know in 1995, platinum with Me and You in 1996 and I Will Stand in 1997 and double platinum with Everywhere We Go in 1999. By 2000, Chesney was a bona fide star who was adored by legions of country music fans.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,' 'When the Sun Goes Down'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2001, Chesney released his first Greatest Hits album, followed by 2002's rock-influenced No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems. Spurred by the highly popular singles "Young" and "The Good Stuff," it became one of the best-selling albums of his career. His follow-up effort, When the Sun Goes Down (2004), also reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and produced three chart-topping singles, including "There Goes My Life."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Be As You Are,' 'The Road and the Radio'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2005, Chesney was honored as the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year for the first time. He released two new albums that year: Be As You Are (Songs From an Old Blue Chair) and The Road and The Radio. Both recordings were smash hits, reaching the top of the country charts with such singles as "Who You'd Be Today" and "Guitars and Tiki Bars." The following year, he released a concert album, Live: Live Those Songs Again, which topped the country charts and made an impressive showing on the pop charts as well.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For his next release, Chesney helped produce Just Who I Am: Poets & Pirates (2007), which featured a slew of hits. The introspective "Don't Blink" topped the country charts as did "Never Wanted Nothing More" and "Better As a Memory." The recording also had two popular duetsâ€”"Every Other Weekend" with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/reba-mcentire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Reba McEntire" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Reba McEntire</a> and "Shiftwork" with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/george-strait data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Strait" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Strait</a>.

His follow-up album, Live in No Shoes Nation, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 later in the year.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Songs for the Saints,' 'Here and Now'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chesney released Songs for the Saints under a new label, Warner Music Nashville, in July 2018, and teamed with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/ed-sheeran data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ed Sheeran" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ed Sheeran</a> to pen "Tip of My Tongue" the following year.
