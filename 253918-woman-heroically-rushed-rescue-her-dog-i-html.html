Tatum was watching both dogs, and when she saw what happened, she quickly jumped in to save her dog.</p><p class=dh>Her backyard's surveillance caught the incident as it happened and how she braved the odds to save Sid. From the footage, which ABC7<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJkYktcpCk4&ab_channel=ABC7"> shared</a>, one can see that Tatum was on the other side of the pool when Sid fell through.</p><p class=dh>She ran to the side where the dog fell through and entered the icy pool searching for Sid. At first, she did not find the dog and got out of the pool. She went to the other end to get a better view from above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0d1defc3f39cdc3d12a3bcac890ad693.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Maltese dog relaxing on sofa at modern living room | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After scanning the pool briefly, she ran back and entered the freezing water once again and pulled Sid, who was barely conscious, out with her.

She added that Sid is about 50 pounds, and all she could think about was how to get him into the house and get him warm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/27e78b1b9f647c3bcd11d7f5f67ae750.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A picture of a winter frozen pond | Photo: Pixabay</p><p class=dh>Sid was submerged in the freezing water for over 60 seconds and a veterinarian, April Smith, said the dog did not have another minute to spare based on his symptoms.</p><p class=dh>Smith said the dog might have held his breath for some time in the water but still needed oxygen to be revived and added that Tatum saved his life. The veterinarian noted that Sid sunk and would not have had a chance without his owner.</p><p class=dh>Tatum's life-saving actions caught news headlines, and she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/us/tennessee-woman-frozen-pool-save-dog>appeared on Fox News</a> to speak about it.

Now, Sid is doing great though he is still a bit skittish on the outside and avoids the pool at all costs.</p><p class=dh>Despite her bravery, Tatum did not consider herself a hero and said she would have jumped into the freezing pool to save anyone's pet.</p><p class=dh>Tatum's courageous act is among several incredible occurrences in Tennessee during the winter storm.
